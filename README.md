## Description
To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file Links to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## Task

WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
